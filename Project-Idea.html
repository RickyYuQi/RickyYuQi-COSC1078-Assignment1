		<h4>Project Idea</h4>
		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>For my project idea I am thinking of creating a quality-of-life improvement application, allowing ease of use for users. The following project I will attempt to create a file management system, capable of automatically sort files stored/created within a system via their name, file type, content stored, and date accessed/modified. This mini program will be able to automatically sort/name and version control files after they have been saved, creating and organising folders in which the files can be stored within. This will allow for the easier navigation of files for the user for future access/reference, and autonomous sorting will free the user from any organisational tasks.</p>
		<h1>Motivation</h1>
		<p>My interest and desire for creating a system/product such as this is for disorganised people such as myself, who often find themselves misplacing documents and/or losing documents due to their insufficient ability to properly name files or folders. By creating an application like this, people will be able to bypass this stage in file creation allowing people to locate files with ease via an automated naming system allowing the user to access their desired files with ease. I am sure many people, myself alike, have been wanting a little widget which can perform little tasks such as this to improve their quality of life when completing daily tasks in the office.</p>
		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p>The designed program will be ideally a little widget/extension which can be applied to a user’s desktop, which can be access whenever they would like. The program will be having the following features attached to the application:
				<ul><strong>Version control.</strong> The program will be able to detect what type of file the document is, which format which it is written in and what application is was last utilised in. By comparing the selected file/file ranged with the existing database, it program will rename/delete duplicates keeping track of which files are updating and removing repeated files reducing data redundancy.</ul>
				<ul><strong>Folder creation and file reallocation.</strong> Scanning the files within a selected range within a storage system, the program will be able to stockpile all ‘like’ files and reallocate them into a central folder based on the file name. If a folder for the allocated documents does not exist, it will create one.</ul>
				<ul><strong>Document management.</strong> As a file orientated program, it will allow the user to mass-edit large portions of documents within their storage system. Such that of a file explorer, it will present all available documents to the user however will preview only documents exclusively excluding other applications/executables. Consequentially, file searches will be performed at much faster rates than the native file explorer.</ul>
		</p>
		<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
		<p>For the project, the creators will require software which have the correct level of authorisation to edit files within the hosts computer system, in order to move and reallocation position of the files. This is essential as some programs do not have high security access towards a computer, thus making editing for version control and file rearrangement an impossible task. An application also capable of writing macros and executing them is essential, as it will allow us to complete certain actions when a certain condition is met, or an action is performed. Other user interface tools can be used to edit the layout and be utilised to better improve the users experience and navigation whilst using the widget.</p>
		<h1>Skills Required</h1>
		<p>In order to complete a program like this, the designers will have to have acquired adequate abilities in creating macros capable of renaming and relocating. In terms of difficulty and required skills and capabilities from the creators, the project will be relatively simple. It will not be necessary to own any special hardware or ownership of any exclusive software to create. Within a group environment, the team will need teamwork and high communication skills, this is as many major components as possible/ steps in this program during the creation process will be highly reliant/dependent on each individual pieces. Individual participants will be expected to complete their assigned tasks in a timely fashion, maintaining up to speed with their teammates acting with initiative without being dependent on the leader(s).</p>
		<h1>Outcome</h1>
		<p>Once the project has been completed the program will ideally be presented as a small widget which users will be able to use to sort their files and rename under their specified conventions through a click of just a few buttons. The issue of a cluttered UI filled with files used/unused will be sorted and named depending on their date or creation. Duplicated files will be version controlled and/or purged to reduce redundancy. Users will now be able to browse through their files with ease, having everything been correctly filed and placed within their related folders. </p>
