      <h2 style="color: #0577b0;font: times;"><strong>Personal Information</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size:  16px;font: times;">My name is Ricky Yu Qi(Ricky) Yao, and I am a furst year university student undergoing study for the Bachelor of Information Technology. I am an Australian from born in Melbourne, Victoria coming from an Asian(Chinese) backgrouund. I chose RMIT to pursue a technologies course as I have heard it has a good techologies program in addition to RMIT's 'unique' city campus structure. I enjoy playing video games and listening to music.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #0577b0;font: times;">Interests in IT</h2>
        <p style="font-size:  16px;font: times;">My interests towards the field of Information Technology came around when I was given knowledge on the fields job security and stability within the career market. My ideals in life have always been to achieve a steady job and stable income in order to live a smooth and comfortable life.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #0577b0;font: times;">Ideal Occupation</h2>
        <p style="font-size:  16px;font: times;">My ideal job in the future is to become a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51780705?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=669a2576-d280-405e-a6ac-de47705ba246">Network & Security Specialist.</a>
        <br><img src="job.jpg" alt="seek.com.au, position of a network and security Specialist">
        <br>The position of network and security specialist appeals to me mainly due to its high stability, high income and increasing demand within the work force. This occupation requires qualifications within the fields of network architecture and cybersecurity, with essential tasks such as managing network infrastructures, analysis of security systems and providing technical aid. As of this moment, I have only recently entered the technology sector having entered this course this year with little to no experience in the field yet. I plan to further this course by pursuing postgraduate study to gain the correct qualifications in order to apply to jobs such as this one.

          Being represented as a 'INFP', I can perform tasks at hand self-sufficiently without the guidance or aid of others. The ability to work alone can be reliable as I do not require may others to produce a viable outcome. However, when placed within a team scenario my communication and competence levels may differ.<br>

          Being represented as an ISFJ-T by the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test, it presents my character as one which seeks constant improvement. As a result, seeks for errors within systems with ideas on what and how to improve/resolve an issue. Within a team environment, I will be capable of assisting my team mostly in assessing the final components of the project, looking for potential issues and problems within the final solution, looking for methods and techniques which could improve the quality of the project.<br>

    <h3 style="color: #0577b0;">Project</h3>
      <h4>[Overview]</h4>
        <p>For my project idea I am thinking of creating a quality-of-life improvement application, allowing ease of use for users. The following project I will attempt to create a file management system, capable of automatically sort files stored/created within a system via their name, file type, content stored, and date accessed/modified. This mini program will be able to automatically sort/name and version control files after they have been saved, creating and organising folders in which the files can be stored within. This will allow for the easier navigation of files for the user for future access/reference, and autonomous sorting will free the user from any organisational tasks. </p>
      <h4>[Motivation]</h4>
        <p>My interest and desire for this product derived from my disorganised nature leading to the inability to locate files exceeding the initial date by which it was created.</p>
