		<h1>Interests in IT</h1>
			<p>My interests towards the field of Information Technology came around when I was given knowledge on the fields job security and stability within the career market. My ideals in life have always been to achieve a steady job and stable income in order to live a smooth and comfortable life. During my time spent studing at RMIT, I except to gain proficient and/or excellent IT capabilies to enter the workforce. This includes knowledge of network architecture and/or cybersecurity. My final decision towards ultimately selecting RMIT as my desired university to complete my education is because acquired name it had towards the field of technology and its campus(city) structure and naming conventions piqued my interest.

			<p>My idea of the perfect job is a <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51780705?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=669a2576-d280-405e-a6ac-de47705ba246">Network and Security Specialist.</a> The position of network and security specialist appeals to me due to its high stability and income within the work force. This occupation requires qualifications within the fields of network architecture and cybersecurity, with essential tasks such that of managing network infrastructures, analysis of security infrastructures and technical support. As of this moment, I have only recently entered the technology sector having enter this course last year with little to no experience in this field yet. I plan to further this course and perhaps obtain other degrees to gain the correct qualifications in order to apply to a job like this one.
